# Conformal spinors

This project contains code to compute conformal correlation functions using the spinor formalism.

For now the only file is the Mathematica notebook `Spinors_3d.nb`.
It focuses on 3 space-time dimensions, and on the following correlators:
- 2-point functions of generic tensor operators
- 3-point functions of two scalar operators and one generic tensor

The results have been used in a pre-print hosted at [https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.12540](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.12540).

The long-term goal is to extend these results to arbitrary primary operators in 3 and 4 space-time dimensions.
