# Conformal spinors

This project contains code to compute conformal correlation functions using the spinor formalism.

For now the only file is the Mathematica notebook `Spinors_3d.nb`.
It focuses on 3 space-time dimensions, and on the following correlators:
- 2-point functions of generic tensor operators
- 3-point functions of two scalar operators and one generic tensor

A publication using these computations is in preparation. It will be freely available at arxiv.org.

The long-term goal is to extend these results to arbitrary primary operators in space-time dimensions 3 and 4.
